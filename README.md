# Rethink-FP-in-AVs-OpenPCDet

## Introduction 
* !!! DDL: Submission to the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal with the ICRA 2022 option (paper and accompanying video deadline Sept 9, 2021). Six pages in standard ICRA format are allowed for each paper, including figures and references, and a maximum of two additional pages can be purchased. Details are provided on the RA-L webpage and FAQ.
* It will be an official code of our conference paper "Rethink the false positive objects in automotive vehicle". 
* The code is based on OpenPCDet under https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet and https://nv-adlr.github.io/publication/2018-Segmentation
* This work will focus on solving the FP issue-> solo LiDAR method tends to detect lots of false positive objects.


## Plan 
* Mai
  * ~~upload "semantic segmentation image" module, "occlusion" module~~
  * upload "point transformer" module @ Simon
  * train **PartA2** with our module -> check PartA2.yaml -> before 21.6

* Juni
  * optimize and upload "multi-modal attention" module @ LeiChen 
  * compare and summary the detection result between original **PartA2**/**PointRCNN**/**PVRCNN** and our version @ Simon& LeiChen 
  
* Juli
  * clean code 
  * submit result to KITTI benchmark
  * write paper


## getting started
* download the semantic segmentation result from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b98adm66H7gt3fOGzDv5s-uMYhSO9y2U?usp=sharing
* prepare your data as following

## Changelog
* 24.05 edit OCCLUSION_DEPTH_MAP,ROI_GRID_POOL_ADD_MODULE in the config, edit kitti_dataset.py and pv_rcnn.py
  * save the depth map and semantic segmentation image in the kitti_dataset.py
  * calculate occlusion feature and semantic segmentation feature in the function _spherical_project_ in pv_rcnn.py
  * merge the pooled_features of grid points with the occlusion feature & semantic segmentation feature of grid point
  * several times of experiments showed that these module can effectively reduce the FP and get the stable improvement **+~5** for Ped and **+~3** for cyclist
